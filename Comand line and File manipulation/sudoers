to set up a new super user you need:
create a new file /etc/sudoers.d/newuser

the vim /etc/sudoers.d/newuser
and add "student ALL=(ALL) ALL"

the chmod 440


of if this doesnt work you can try "visudo" command
and add student account below root

student ALL=(ALL) ALL

if this doesnt work you can add user to sudoers group
usermod -G root admin
